** Note: For this code to be fully functional, API integration is required.
So for that reason we have manually entered the data of logged in 
student. **
Following are the modules of App
•Student Behavior in Online class
•Real-time academic progress. i.e. graphs/charts of progress throughout the semester
•Set Goal i.e. set goal for cgpa and app will let you know regularly that how far you are to achieve your goal.
•Online payment at cafeteria, parking ticket, book shop etc.
•Online application of Loan and also app shows all data regarding loan like date of payment, loan approved or not etc.
•Internships and jobs according to the student expertise. For this student data will be required and after 
that student can apply for a job or internship by just a press of a button, no need to enter information again and again.


Use of Block Chain: There are 2 source of data that would be used by app. one is the academic data and that would be
 recieved from university data base and second one is jobs and internships and that would be recived from the api through different
jobs posting sites. for quick application for loan,job and internship app would have data of student and this data would be store using
block chain/data decentrilization.

Compiler used is visual studio and codeblock.
Language used is C++.
